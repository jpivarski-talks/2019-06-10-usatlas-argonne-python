Jim's tutorials for U.S. ATLAS Python training at Argonne:

   * Argonne National Lab
   * Building 360 Room A-224
   * 9:00am â€’ 4:30pm

To participate, either install all of the software on your laptop (with [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html), an isolated environment that you can remove with `conda remove --name usatlas-argonne-python --all`):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jpivarski/2019-06-10-usatlas-argonne-python.git
cd 2019-06-10-usatlas-argonne-python
conda env create -f environment.yml         # create an isolated environment and install everything
conda activate usatlas-argonne-python       # switch to that environment (maybe "source activate...")
conda install jupyterlab
jupyter lab                                 # runs on your machine, controlled by your web browser
```
